## Opti-Soft+: A Recommender and Sensitivity Analysis for Optimal Software Feature Selection and Release Planning

**Authors:** Fernando Boccanera and Alexander Brodsky

**Number:** GMU-CS-TR-2022-1

**Abstract:**

Many approaches have been developed to increase the return on a software investment, but each one has drawbacks. Proposed in this paper is the Opti-Soft+ framework that addresses this problem by producing a software release schedule that maximizes the business value of investments in information systems that automate business processes. The optimal release schedule is the result of solving a mixed integer linear programming problem. Opti-Soft+ includes a formal optimization model, a Decision Guidance System that implements the model and a methodology. Opti-Soft+ is an extension of the Opti-Soft framework proposed earlier with (1) a refined cost model, (2) a technique for sensitivity analysis of the normalized cost per unit of production, and (3) an atomic business process model that is driven by output throughputs in addition to input throughputs.
