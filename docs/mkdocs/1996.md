## A General Framework for Time Granularity and Its Application to Temporal Reasoning

**Authors:** Claudio Bettini, X. Sean Wang, and Sushil Jajodia

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-10

**Abstract:**

This paper presents a general framework to define time granularity systems. We identify the main dimensions along which different systems can be characterized, and investigate the formal relationships among granularities in these systems. The paper also introduces the notion of a network of temporal constraints with (multiple) granularities emphasizing the semantic and computational differences from constraint networks with a single granularity. Consistency of networks with multiple granularities is shown to be NP-hard in general and approximate solutions for this problem and for the "minimal network" problem are proposed.

## Mutation Operators for Ada

**Authors:** A. Jefferson Offutt, Jeff Voas, and Jeff Payne

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-09

**Abstract:**

Mutation analysis is a method for testing software. It provides a method for assessing the adequacy of test data. This report describes the mutation operators defined for the Ada programming language. The mutation operators are categorized using syntactic criteria, in a form suitable for an implementor of a mutation-based system, or a tester wishing to understand how mutation analysis can be used to test Ada programs. Each mutation operator is carefully defined, and when appropriate, implementation notes and suggestions are provided. We include operators for all syntactic elements of Ada, including exception handling, generics, and tasking. A summary table listing all operators for Ada, and compared with C and Fortran operators is also provided. The design described here is the result of deliberations among the authors in which all aspects of the Ada language and software development in Ada were considered. These operators can also be viewed as the culmination of previous mutation operator definitions for other languages. This report is intended to serve as a manual for the Ada mutation operators.

## Applying Logic-based Database to Impact Analysis of Object-oriented Software

**Authors:** Li Li and Jeff Offutt

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-08

**Abstract:**

As the software industry has matured, we have shifted our resources, once devoted to developing new software systems, to making modifications in evolving software systems. A major problem for developers in an evolutionary environment is that seemingly small changes can ripple throughout the system to have major unintended impacts elsewhere. As a result, software developers need mechanisms to understand how a change to a software system will affect the rest of the system. Although the effects of changes in object-oriented are restricted, they are also more subtle and more difficult to detect. The technique presented in this paper allows software developers to perform "what if" analysis on the effect of proposed changes, and thereby choose the change that has the least influence on the rest of the system. The analysis also adds valuable information to regression testing, by suggesting what classes and methods need to be re-tested, and to project managers, who can use the results for cost estimation and schedule planning. This paper presents algorithms to analyze the potential impacts of changes to object-oriented software, taking into account encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and implements the algorithms using datalog, a deductive database model. Using the datalog makes the implementation of the algorithms relatively easier. It also expands the range of the impact analysis of the object-oriented system to any interesting questions that can be expressed by the datalog query.

## The C3 Constraints Object-Oriented Database System

**Authors:** Alexander Brodsky, Victor E. Segal, and Pavel A. Exarkhopoulo

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-07

**Abstract:**

Constraints provide a flexible and uniform way to conceptually represent diverse data capturing spatio-temporal behavior, complex modeling requirements, partial and incomplete information etc, and have been used in a wide variety of application domains. Constraint databases have recently emerged to deeply integrate data captured by constraints in databases. This paper reports on the development of the first constraint object-oriented database system}, Ccube, and describes its specification, design and implementation. The Ccube system is designed to be used for both implementation and optimization of high-level constraint object-oriented query languages such as LyriC or constraint extensions of OQL, and for directly building software systems requiring extensible use of constraint database features. The Ccube data manipulation language, Constraint Comprehension Calculus, is an integration constraint calculus for extensible constraint domains within monoid comprehensions, which serve as an optimization-level language for object-oriented queries. The data model for constraint calculus is based on constraint spatio-temporal (CST) objects that may hold spatial, temporal or constraint data, conceptually represented by constraints. New CST objects are constructed, manipulated and queried by means of constraint calculus. The model for monoid comprehensions, in turn, is based on the notion of monoids, which is a generalization of collection and aggregation types to structures over which one can iterate and apply merge operator; this includes disjunctions and conjunctions of constraints. The focal point of our work is achieving the right balance between expressiveness, complexity and representation usefulness, without which the practical use of the system would not be possible. To that end, C3 constraint calculus guarantees polynomial time data complexity, and, furthermore, is tightly integrated with monoid comprehensions to allow deep global optimization.

## Discovering Temporal Relationships with Multiple Granularities in Time Sequences

**Authors:** Claudio Bettini, X. Sean Wang, Sushil Jajodia, and Jia-Ling Lin

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-06

**Abstract:**

An important usage of time sequences is to discover temporal patterns. The discovery process usually starts with a user-specified skeleton, called an "event structure", which consists of a number of variables representing events and temporal constraints among these variables; and the goal of the discovery is to find temporal patterns, i.e., instantiations of the variables in the structure, which frequently appear in the time sequence. This paper introduces event structures that have temporal constraints with multiple granularities, defines the pattern discovery problem with these structures, and studies effective algorithms to solve it. The basic components of the algorithms include timed automata with granularities (TAGs) and a number of heuristics. The TAGs are for testing whether a specific temporal pattern, called a "candidate complex event type", appears frequently in a time sequence. Since there are often a huge number of candidate event types for a usual event structure, heuristics are presented aiming at reducing the number of candidate event types and reducing the time spent by the TAGs to test whether a candidate type does appear frequently in the sequence. These heuristics exploit the information provided by explicit and implicit temporal constraints with granularity in the given event structure. The paper also gives the results of an experiment to show the effectiveness of the heuristics on a real data set.

## Algorithms for Change Impact Analysis of Object-oriented Software

**Authors:** Li Li and A. Jefferson Offutt

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-02

**Abstract:**

As the software industry has matured, we have shifted from almost exclusively devoting our resources to the development of new software systems to devoting large portions of our resources to making modifications to evolving software systems. A major problem for developers in an evolutionary environment is that seemingly small changes in one place can ripple throughout the system to have major unintended impacts elsewhere, thus, software developers need mechanisms to understand what impact a change to a software system will have on the rest of the system. With object-oriented software, the impacts of changes are restricted (largely because of encapsulation), but are also more subtle and harder to determine. This paper presents algorithms to analyze potential impacts of changes to object-oriented software, taking into account encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This technique allows software developers to perform "what if" analysis on the impacts of proposed changes, and thereby choose the change that has the least impact on the rest of the system. The analysis also offers valuable information to regression testing, by suggesting what classes and methods need to be retested, and to project managers, who can use the results for cost estimation and schedule planning.

## Subsumption of Condition Coverage Techniques by Mutation Testing

**Authors:** A. Jefferson Offutt and Jeffrey M. Voas

**Number:** ISSE-TR-96-01

**Abstract:**

Condition coverage testing is a family of testing techniques that are based on the logical flow of control through a program. The condition coverage techniques include a variety of requirements, including that each statement in the program is executed and that each branch is executed. Mutation testing is a fault-based testing technique that is widely considered to be very powerful, and that imposes requirements on testing that include, and go beyond, many other techniques. In this paper, we consider the six common condition coverage techniques, and formally show that these techniques are subsumed by mutation testing, in the sense that if mutation testing is satisfied, then the condition coverage techniques are also satisfied. The fact that condition coverage techniques are subsumed by mutation has immediate practical significance because the extensive research that has already been done for mutation can be used to support condition coverage techniques, including automated tools for performing mutation testing and generating test cases.
